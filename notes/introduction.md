## General Information

Thank you for your attendance & welcome to the *Collaboration* Workshop.
This is an offering by the University of Adelaide,
Bioinformatics Hub which is a centrally funded initiative from the Department of Vice-Chancellor (Research),
with the aim of assisting & enabling researchers in their work.
Training workshops & seminars such as this one are an important part of this initiative.

Some additional resources run by the Bioinformatics Hub which may be of interest beyond today are:

- A University web-page at http://www.adelaide.edu.au/bioinformatics-hub/
- To be kept up to date on upcoming events and workshops, please join the internal Bioinformatics mailing list on http://list.adelaide.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/ bioinfo
- A Twitter account https://twitter.com/UofABioinfoHub/
- An active Slack team for discussing Bioinformatics questions with the local community. Slack teams do require an invitation to join, so please email the Hub on bioinf_hub@adelaide.edu.au to join the community. All are welcome.

Today’s workshop has been put together by Dan Kortschak.
We hope it will be useful in enabling you to continue and to advance your research.

## Course Summary

Collaboration in the production of software and text is a crucial aspect of bioinformatics research.
In the past, researchers and others depended on *ad hoc* approaches to maintaining date or number-annotated filenames,
archives of files, online shared drives, and proprietary solutions such as change tracking in word processing software.

None of these approaches scale well or allow safe and informative histories to be available for auditing the collaboration process.

More recently shared editing platforms such as google docs have become available which goes someway towards this,
but cannot be used for collaboration on software projects and lack some features that help in the collaboration process.

There are rich solutions to the problem though that have existed in the domain of software engineering for some time.

In this course, we will explain the foundations of modern collaboration tools and demonstrate current good practice in the use of available tools.

## Recommendations For Working

In the following pages, we strongly encourage you to manually type all commands.
The mistakes you will inevitably make will actually be important learning steps.
Additionally, in your work beyond today, you will probably not have any instructions to follow.
The experience of typing these commands will equip you for future work far better than if you simply copy & paste.

For today’s session, you will also be provided with red post-it notes.
**Please use these to signal whether you need help or not by placing them on your monitors**.
These are easy for instructors to spot so we can make our way over, although do be aware that there will be times when all instructors are busy.
This will be important as we all set our computers up in the following section.

## Computer Setup

For those running OSX or Ubuntu we will be able to run today's session on your own machines.
Many bioinformticians use these operating systems so the suite of tools is relatively mature.
In order to correctly configure your computer for today's session, please follow the links below.

- [Mac/OSX](../install/osxInstall)
- [Windows](../install/windowsInstall)
- [Ubuntu](../install/ubuntuInstall)
